# SLM RAG Project

**The full project can be viewed in the "SLM_RAG_Project.ipynb" file**

This project creates a simple implementation of a small language model enhanced with Retrieval-augmented Generation.

Today, Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has become almost a standard for LLMs. However, there are few implementations of RAG within small language models. This project implements a lightweight RAG into a SLM.

This project utilizes Hugging Face's SmolLM-360M parameter SLM and all-MiniLM-L6-v2 SentenceTransformer for text embeddings.
